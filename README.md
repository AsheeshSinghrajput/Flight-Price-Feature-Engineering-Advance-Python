# Flight-Price-Feature-Engineering-Advance-Python

## Project Objective
I downloaded a flight dataset from Kaggle to perform feature engineering for machine learning. First, I concatenated the training dataset (10,683 rows) and the test dataset (2,671 rows) into a single dataset. After that, I identified the null values and used statistical methods to impute them. Next, I split several columns into new features â€” for example, I separated the Duration column into Duration_Hours and Duration_Minutes, and the Date of Journey column into Day, Month, and Year. I also converted categorical variables into numerical values for model compatibility.
